\title{New Foundations is consistent}
\author{Sky Wilshaw}
\date{January 2024}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	We give a self-contained account of a version of Holmes' proof \cite{holmes2023nf} that Quine's set theory \emph{New Foundations} \cite{quine-nf} is consistent relative to the metatheory ZFC.
	This is a `deformalisation' of the formal proof written in Lean at \cite{leanprover-community-con-nf}.

\section{Overview}

\lean{inflexible_iff}

In \cref{sec:theories}, we outline the context for the proof we will present.
The mathematical background expected in subsequent sections will be limited to basic familiarity with cardinals and ordinals.
We will then give an outline of the proof in \cref{sec:outline}.
In \cref{sec:structure}, we introduce some basic preliminaries, and explicitly describe the structure within which our model will reside.
The objects of our model will be constructed in \cref{sec:construction}.
We then show the main technical theorem, the \emph{freedom of action theorem}, in \cref{sec:foa}.

All proofs given in \cref{sec:structure,sec:construction,sec:foa} are verified by Lean \cite{lean}, which is a functional programing language and interactive theorem prover.
Most of our proofs are written in Lean's \emph{tactic mode}, in which Lean tracks a number of hypotheses and goals, and we instruct it via tactics to update these hypotheses and goals according to logical rules.
There are a large variety of tactics to perform different tasks, such as simplification (\texttt{simp}), rewriting of subexpressions (\texttt{rw}), case splitting (\texttt{cases} and \texttt{by\_cases}), and so on.
These tactics output a \emph{proof term}, which is then passed to Lean's \emph{kernel}.
The kernel is a small program that verifies proofs by performing a type-checking algorithm.
Lean's kernel is the only code that must be `trusted' in order to guarantee that a proof accepted by Lean as a whole is correct, since any unsound tactics would output a proof term that is not type-correct.

We made frequent use of the community-made repository \texttt{mathlib} \cite{mathlib2020}, which encodes standard mathematical definitions and theorems in Lean; without this, we would have needed to write our own libraries for abstract algebra and cardinal and ordinal arithmetic.

It is important to note that although theorems can be verified by Lean's kernel, it has no way of knowing whether a formal definition written in Lean matches the familiar mathematical definition; any definitions used in a theorem statement must be manually checked.
For example, if verifying a proof of Fermat's last theorem, it would suffice to manually check the definitions of natural numbers, addition, exponentiation, and natural equalities and inequalities.

Carneiro proved in \cite{leantt} that Lean's type theory is consistent relative to
\[ \text{ZFC} + \{ \text{there are } n \text{ inaccessible cardinals} \mid n < \omega \} \]
These inaccessible cardinals are needed to support Lean's hierarchy of type universes.
Higher universes are used by \texttt{mathlib} whenever they are convenient, for example in its definitions of cardinals and ordinals.
However, these uses are not strictly necessary for our purposes, and the entire proof can be carried out in plain ZFC, as shown by \cite{holmes2023nf} and this paper.

\emph{%
	Note: At the present time, the formal proof \cite{leanprover-community-con-nf} is incomplete, and this paper reflects the unfinished state of that proof.
	We aim to keep this paper proof in line with the formal proof, although as the project is ongoing, some variance is to be expected.
	The current version of the paper is available at \url{https://zeramorphic.github.io/con-nf-paper/main.pdf}.
